1. RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries. It also easily manages the installation of gems and a server for distributing them. 

2.Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers the initialization of an object until the point it's needed.Eager loading differs from this in that it loads all related entities as part of the query.

3. CREATE TABLE creates a new table in a database, and INSERT INTO inserts new records into a table. 

4. Include is used to add methods to an instance of a class and extend is for adding class methods. Extend is public method and include is a private one. 

5. Using an instance method is necessary as we only want to record a change on a particular method and not an entire class. Without doing so will result to unnecessary changes to an entire class.

6. UPDATE character
   SET name = "Jar-Jar Binks"
   WHERE id = 1
   ;

7. I need to reestablish the an updated initialize method, or complete the code in a way that we will connect it to the database created.

8. def snake(snake_word)
    string = snake_word.gsub(/::/, '/')
    string.gsub!(/_([a-z])/, capitalize)
  end   

9. def find_by(attribute, value)
    row = connection.get_first_row <<-SQL
      SELECT #{columns.join ","} FROM #{table}
      WHERE attribute = #{BlocRecord::Utility.sql_strings(value)}
    SQL

    return find_object(row)
   end
